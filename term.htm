Implementation</font></b></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We are happy to release our datasets and source 
codes so that peer researchers can reconstruct the experimental results in our 
papers. Furthermore, we would be very delighted if our testbed and 
implementation would be beneficial to the community for developing new 
techniques and algorithms. </font></p>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Copyrights</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">All rights of the datasets and implementation 
are reserved by the authors. The datasets and source codes are owned by the 
universities they serve. </font></p>

<p>The datasets and source codes are free only for non-commercial use. They must 
not be distributed without prior permission of the author. The author is not 
responsible for implications from the use of them. If you use either the 
datasets or the code in your scientific work, please cite our related papers.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt">Bug Reports</span></h2>
<p>If you find bugs for the codes/datasets, please contact me via email:

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Please be reminded that all the 
datasets/source codes are released as the way they are. We would be delighted if 
you could use the datasets in your research and understand the implementation, 
and adapt it for your own purposes. If you cannot understand it, please kindly 
write your own codes. Our codes should be regarded as &quot;freeware&quot;, for which the 
authors do not hold any responsibility. Emails soliciting explanation may be
