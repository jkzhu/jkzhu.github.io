<h3> Research interest </h3>
My research focuses on computer vision and multimedia information retrieval. I have worked on a variety of novel techniques and their applications to nonrigid shape recovery, image alignment, 3D surface reconstruction, multimedia search and annotation, augmented reality and digit entertainment. I am especially interested in developing new image alignment techniques, which are fundamental to many vision and multimedia applications.
